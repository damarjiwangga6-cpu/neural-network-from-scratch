# Neural Network From Scratch
this project is a fully handmade neural network built **entirely in pure Python** with:

- manual forward pass
- manual backpropagation
- custom loss functions
- text-based dataset support
- from zero frameworks, zero libraries, zero shortcuts

this is my long-term personal project and will grow over time. my first big goal for coding essentially :3
